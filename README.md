## 🧠 AI Timetable Generator

Smart Weekly Study Planner using AI and Streamlit

# 📘 Overview

The AI Timetable Generator is a smart web application that automatically creates an optimized weekly timetable based on subjects, their weekly study periods, and priorities (e.g., subjects to be placed before lunch).

It ensures balanced workload distribution, fixed lunch timing, and shuffled free periods, making study planning efficient and personalized for every student.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Input subjects with custom weekly period requirements<br>
✅ Set subject priorities (for morning slots or before lunch)<br>
✅ Automatically fixes lunch time<br>
✅ Shuffles free periods across days<br>
✅ Generates 10 different timetable variations<br>
✅ Clean, gradient-styled user interface<br>
✅ Fully responsive and deployable via Streamlit Cloud<br>

# 🧩 How It Works

Enter your subjects (comma-separated).

Enter total study hours per day.

Set lunch time and mark subjects that should appear before lunch (priority subjects).

Specify the number of weekly periods for each subject.

Click "Generate Timetable" — the AI logic distributes subjects evenly, ensuring fairness and variation.

You’ll receive 10 randomized, well-balanced timetables to choose from.
